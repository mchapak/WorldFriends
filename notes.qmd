1.  The number of suspected, tested and positive malaria by RDT reported by the CHEWs (MOH515 summary) is not consistent with the numbers reported in MOH706.

2. The proportion of tests conducted and positivity compares periods in 2023 and 2024 for the months of September-December (total). This is because there was no baseline data available for periods before the interventions.
