This was in response to several concerns raised by the Kenya coastal health authorities regarding the fight against malaria. Some of the concerns raised include low usage and access to insecticide treated nets (ITNs), low adherence to Intermittent Preventive Treatment in pregnancy (IPTp), incorrect information about malaria, challenges in screening, diagnosis, and follow up and over-treatment of malaria.
