This was in response to several concerns raised by the Kenya coastal health authorities regarding the fight against malaria. Some of the concerns raised include low usage and access to insecticide treated nets (ITNs), low adherence to Intermittent Preventive Treatment in pregnancy (IPTp), incorrect information about malaria, challenges in screening, diagnosis, and follow up and over-treatment of malaria.\n\nThis project aimed to “Contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goal 3.3 By 2030, end the malaria epidemic and 3.8: Achieve Universal Health Coverage”.
