The program aimed to strengthen community-based malaria eradication mechanisms by 2024 through awareness campaigns, capacity building, and data collection improvements.\n\nThis report documents the impact of The Netâ€™s activities and their outcomes in Kilifi County. It also describes the acceptance and sustainability of the initiative by the beneficiaries and stakeholders.\n\n### Study sites\n\nThe map below shows the location of the 10 health facilities within the 5 sub-counties ([**Ganze**]{style=\"color:#8dd3c7\"}, [**Kaloleni**]{style=\"color:#d8b365\"}, [**Kilifi North**]{style=\"color:#ef8a62\"}, [**Kilifi South**]{style=\"color:#bebada\"}, [**Rabai**]{style=\"color:#b3de69\"}) that participated in the study.
