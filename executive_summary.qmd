The Net - Community Based Malaria Programme was implemented in Kilifi County, Kenya from 2023 to 2025 to address low ITN usage, IPTp adherence, and malaria-related challenges. The program aimed to strengthen community-based malaria eradication mechanisms by 2024 through awareness campaigns, capacity building, and data collection improvements.

This report documents the impact of The Netâ€™s activities and their outcomes in Kilifi County. It also describes the acceptance and sustainability of the initiative by the beneficiaries and stakeholders.
